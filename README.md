Twitter-LinkedIN-For-iOS
========================

Integrating LinkedIn and Twitter altogether in iOS was always pain. Created a framework for Twitter (API 1.1) and LinkedIN for easy use.

These frameworks are amalgumation of two projects.

Credit goes to Nathaniel Symer for making beautiful twitter framework and synedra for LinkedIN.
